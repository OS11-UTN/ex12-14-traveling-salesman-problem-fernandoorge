### Repo organization

Each exercise of the assignment is solved in a different file
* **ex12.py** for exercise 12
* **ex13.py** for exercise 13
* **ex14.py** for exercise 14
* **logistics.py** constains some useful functions developed by me. 


### Solution to exercise 12
```
1) Try to solve the TSP with a LP matching model. 
   Use the scipy.linprog package. 
   For the cities coordinates use random points.
```
